    By Tweaking ChatGPT code we were able to use this image as a sample image for training:
    <br />
    <a href="https://github.com/JerryMa326/Shenendehowa-Chemistry-Club">
    <img src="strip_image.png" alt="strips" width="500" height="500">
    </a>
    <br />
    Using the ChatGPT Code, the image gave a Mean Absolute Error of 0.4, where an accpted range is between 0.1 and 0.2, as well as a Mean Squared error of 0.16, which should be approaching 0. These errors indicate that we need more training data. This is an implementation of Matplotlib to plot the training data:
    <br />
    <a href="https://github.com/JerryMa326/Shenendehowa-Chemistry-Club">
    <img src="initialPlot" alt="plot" width="500" height="500">
    </a>
      <br />
Unfortunatley, this data is not correct as with the training image, the RGB values seem to be taken from a random sector of the image, not a centered focus on each chip, this makes the values filed with noise and not true representations. In a sequel code attatched, it can be Cropped alongside a more advanced Tensorflow model rather than a KNN model. With this iteration, we could add a folder of training data and implement a similar Matplotlib function to graph, and later directly implement the prediction model with the same code with a Raspberry Pi and a camera module.
